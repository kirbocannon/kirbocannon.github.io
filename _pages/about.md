I'm a technology enthusiast living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn who will definitely try your friend's recommendation of overpriced "_artisan_" (insert whatever food here). I code because I like to build things, sometimes from trendy hipster coffee shops. I work as a Network Automation Engineer at Network To Code where we help businesses automate building and maintaining their network infrastructure.
