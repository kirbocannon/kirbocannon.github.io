I'm a technology enthusiast living in Brooklyn who defintely will try your friend's recommendation of overpriced _artisan_ <<insert whatever food here>>. I code because I like to build things, sometimes from trendy hipster coffee shops. I work as a Network Automation Engineer at Network To Code where we help businesses automate their network infrastructure.
